    "> _The four code cells below are not necessary for answering this question; however, they introduce two very practical helpful tools for the **multiple linear regression** context that are immediately relevant for this question. The first is the so-called **condition number** (of a \"design matrix\") which provides a very simple diagnostic which can serve as a measure the degree of **multicollinearity** that is present in a **model fit**. If this number is \"very large\" then there is a large degree of **multicollinearity** and suggests room for doubt regarding the **generalizability** of the **fitted model**. The second tool(s) are the `center` and `scale` functions. It is best practice to \"center and scale\" **continuous predictor variables** (but not **indicator variables**) in the **multiple linear regression** context as is done below. While \"centering and scaling\" does make interpreting the predictions on the original scale of the data slighly more complicated, it also must be done in order to get a \"true\" evaluation of the degree of **multicollinearity** present in a **model fit** using the **condition number** of the model (\"design matrix\"). The examples below show that the **condition number** reported by a **fitted model** are \"artificially inflacted\" if \"centering and scaling\" is not used. Specically, they show that the **condition number** of `model3_fit` is really `1.66` (as opposed to the \"very large\" `343` which is reported without \"centering and scaling\"); whereas, the **condition number** for `model4_fit` is \"very (VERY) large\" irrespective of \"centering and scaling\", showing that the overwheling presense of **multicollinearity** in `model4_fit` is in fact a very real thing.  Indeed, we have already seen that `model4_fit` is grossly **overfit** and does not remotely **generalize** beyond its **training** dataset. Without knowing this, however, the comically large **condition number** for `model4_fit` (after \"centering and scaling\") makes it abundantly clear that we should have great doubts about the likely **generalizability** of `model4_fit` (even without examining specific aspects of **multicollinearity** directly or examining \"in sample\" versus \"out of sample\" **model performance** comparisions)._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _The \"specific aspects of **multicollinearity**\" reference above refer to understanding and attributing the detrmimental affects of specific **predictor variables** towards **multicollinearity**. This can be done using so-called **variance inflation factors**, but this is beyond the scope of STA130. We should be aware that the presence of excessive **multicollinearity** as indicated by a large **condition number** for a (\"centered and scaled\") **fitted model** raises grave concerns regarding the potential **generalizability** of the model._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _The `np.corrcoef(model4_spec.exog)` examination of the **correlations** of a \"design matrix\" considered in ths problems prompt is analogous to the examination of the **correlations** present in a dataset that might considered when initially examining the **predictor variables** of a dataset, such as `pokeaman.iloc[:,4:12].corr()`. Indeed, such an examination is often the first step in examining the potential presence of **multicollinearity** among the **predictor variables** of a dataset. However, these are consideration of **pairwise correlation**, whereas **multicollinearity** generalizes this notion to the full collection of **predictor variables** together. A **condition number** for a \"centered and scale\" version of a **fit model** can therefore be viewed as serving the analogous purposes of a multivariate generalization of **pairwise correlation**._\n",

    "> _While we had seemed to **validate** the **generalizability** of `model7_fit` in **model building** exercise of the previous \"Question 7\" above, as well as the improved **model performance** of `model7_fit` comapred to `model6_fit`, the `model7_fit` model was always nonetheless more complex than `model6_fit` model (as seen by comparing their `.summary()` methods). This complexity, despite the minimal concerns regarding **multicollinearity**, should always have suggested some room for caution. This is because, as previously discussed in \"Question 6\" above, a complex **linear form** specification can allow a \"**model fit** to 'detect' idiosyncratic associations spuriously present specifically in the **training** dataset but which did not **generalize** to the **testing** dataset.\" Indeed, a close look at the **p-values** in `model7_fit.summary()` will show that the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model7_fit` is in fact not very strong. In comparision, the **evidence** (in the data) for many of the **estimated coefficients** of `model6_fit.summary()` is consistently stronger._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _As discussed towards the end of the commentary in the previous \"Question 7\" above, the primary purpose of **multiple linear regression** methodology is to allow us to assess the **evidence** (in the data) for a given **linear form** specification based on **coefficient hypothesis testing**. In this regard, then, `model6_fit` might be preferred over `model7_fit` despite the better \"out of sample\" **model performance** of `model7_fit` over `model6_fit`. This may not be enough to convince everyone however, so an additional consideration that might be made here is that the more simpler (more parsimoneous) nature of `model6_fit` should be preferred over `model7_fit` from the perspective of **model interpretability**. Indeed, it is quite unclear how exactly one should think about and understand a four-way **interaction** variable such as `Attack:Speed:Q(\"Sp. Def\"):Q(\"Sp. Atk\")` in conjunction with the whole host of the additional lower order interations. From a **model interpretability** perspective, understanding the meaning of the complex specification of `model7_fit` is \"challenging\" and \"complicated\" to say the least._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - _There are also often circumstances where **model interpretability** can be MORE IMPORTANT than raw **model performance** in \"out of sample\" **prediction**._\n",
    "> - _This is ESPECIALLY true if **predictive model performance** is relatively comparable between models of two different complexity levels. In such cases, the benefits of better **model interpretability** might provide a clear argument for the simpler (more parsimoneous) model, not to mention the additional potential benefit of more consistent improved **generalizability** over the the more complex model this might offer._\n",
    ">\n",
    "> _This question drives home the point that a simpler (more parsimoneous) model always offers the potential benefit of more consistent **generalizability**, not to mention **interpretability**, over more complex models. We should *ONLY* use increasingly complex models that without questions outperfrm simler models. The code below illustrates this by further additionally raising the consideration that the random **train-test** approach used above is actually not the most natural one available for our dataset, which has different \"Generations\". In fact, if we were actually using this model to make **predictions**, we would increasingly acquire more data over time which we would use to make **precictions** about future data which we haven't yet seen, which is what the code demonstrates. And low and behold, this exposes **generalizability** concerns that we missed when we used the dataset in an idealized way and not actually how we would use such a dataset in practice in the real world (where data would arrive sequentially, and current data is used to predict future data). These **generalizability** concerns do affect both models, but the appear to be more problematic for `model7_fit` than `model6_fit`, which is certainly a result of the increased complexity of `model7_fit` which always opens up the possibility of model **overfitting**._\n",
